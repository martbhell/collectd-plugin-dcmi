# In principle DCMI is nice in that it provides a tighter specified subset of IPMI.
# For power consumption, this seems to work.
# However, for temperature readings, in practice:
# - some systems report incorrect record id's with
#   ipmi-dcmi --get-dcmi-sensor-info
# - others don't report at all.
# - Yet others report errors for
#   ipmitool dcmi get_temp_reading
# - ipmi-sensors generally works but different systems have different
#   sensors and different sensor names for the equivalent sensors. In
#   the end, we're only interested in the inlet temperature. So first
#   try to figure out the record id of the inlet temperature sensor.

# Note: collectd metric names should follow
# https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Naming_schema 
# See /usr/share/collectd/types.db for list of builtin types

# Only run this on c* nodes
